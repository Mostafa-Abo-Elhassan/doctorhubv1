Flowers Project
This project aims to showcase and manage flowers online. Users can view different flowers with images, prices, and detailed information. The goal is to create a simple website where anyone can browse flowers and potentially select their favorites.
Features

Display flowers with pictures and prices.
Simple and clean design using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
User-friendly navigation between pages.
Admin page to add new flowers (implemented using JavaScript to dynamically update the DOM).

How to Use

Clone or download this repository to your computer.
Open the index.html file in your browser.
Navigate through the pages to explore different flowers.
If you are an admin, visit the admin page to add a new flower (enter details in the form, and refresh to see updates).

Common Mistakes

Forgetting to link CSS or JS files in HTML (ensure <link> and <script> tags are correctly placed in index.html).
Not providing the correct image path, causing images not to display (verify paths like ../assets/images/22.jpg).
Misspelling or incorrectly typing flower information in the admin page.
Not refreshing the page after adding a new flower to see changes.

Future Improvements

Connect to a real database (e.g., MySQL or Firebase) to save flowers online persistently.
Add a secure login system for admins using encrypted credentials.
Enhance responsive design for mobile devices by testing on various screen sizes and using CSS media queries (e.g., @media (max-width: 768px)).
Improve security by implementing HTTPS and protecting the admin page from unauthorized access.
